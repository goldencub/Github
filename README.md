# DEVELOPER LOG

### Dev Logs

#### 17.06.25 

- started logging programming progress, will record what was learned on each day so I can revisit and practice. ( This is already 119 days into my coding journey FYI)

- Using chatgpt to generate javascript .map() exercises to continue practicing.

- wrote a function to capitize first letter of each word in an array
- wrote a function to double each number in an array
- need to really nail .map(), .filter(), .sort() this week
- Array cardio - end of day revisit organising an array by years lived. 


#### 18.06.25

- focused on creating my portfolio site for photography using a few tutorials as a guideline
- HTML frame and basic CSS is set up for landing page
- Need to think of one or two other projects (NOT a to do list/weather app) that will teach me as well as make me stand out for job searches.
