- started logging programming progress, will record what was learned on each day so I can revisit and practice. ( This is already 119 days into my coding journey FYI)

- Using chatgpt to generate javascript .map() exercises to continue practicing.

- wrote a function to capitize first letter of each word in an array
- wrote a function to double each number in an array
- need to really nail .map(), .filter(), .sort() this week
- Array cardio - end of day revisit organising an array by years lived.
